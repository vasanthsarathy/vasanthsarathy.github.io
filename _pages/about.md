I am a Research Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/). My [research](research) is at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I use techniques in neuro-symbolic machine learning (incl. LLMs and VLMs), social/cognitive sciences, and linguistics to study **social reasoning** and build **socially-competent and safe AI**.  

Previously, I was a Senior Researcher of AI at [Smart Information Flow Technologies (SIFT)](https://www.sift.net/), where I worked closely with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community on several AI-related projects. Prior to that I was a practicing IP lawyer at the law firm of [Ropes and Gray](https://www.ropesgray.com/en) for nearly a decade. I obtained a dual-PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/), advised by [Matthias Scheutz](https://hrilab.tufts.edu/) and [Dan Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett). I earned an MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), a BS in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/) and a J.D from [Boston University School of Law](https://www.bu.edu/law/). 

This **[2023 BU Law article](https://www.bu.edu/law/record/articles/2023/drawing-on-law-to-study-ai/)** summarizes my journey.

Outside of work, I spend time with my wife, three kids, and other family and friends. When I have some spare time, I make art ([single-panel cartoons](/legally-drawn), alcohol inks, math art), practice [shaolin-kempo-karate style martial arts](https://kempoinfo.com/) and play chess.
