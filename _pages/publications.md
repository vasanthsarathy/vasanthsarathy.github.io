<!-- Need to update this. I think I want to categorize by research area, but I could just as easily include a project page. I like Tom Silver's site for this as he has it organized by research themes, and papers within each theme. Maybe I rename this page to "Research" instead of Publications. I can just create a new page called  "Research " and copy some code about dividing up into different categories

You can add custom fields in bib: https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/discussions/642

Maybe I should add a field called: "category" or "tags" 

The problem Is I have many tags .... Need to simplify into three clean categories.
